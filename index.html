                    The earliest extant description of what is now often called a cupcake was in 1796, when a recipe for "a
                    light cake to bake in small cups" was written in American Cookery by Amelia Simmons.

                <p>[1][2] The earliest
                    extant documentation of the term cupcake itself was in "Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and
                    Sweetmeats" in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's Receipts cookbook.[3][4]

                    A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a variety of
                    forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always, have
                    a glossy "skin" on their upper crust. They may also include nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate
                    chips, or other ingredients.

                A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in the
                    batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States at the end
                    of the 19th century and popularized there during the first half of the 20th century.

                    Cotton candy, also known as fairy floss and candy floss, is a spun sugar confection that resembles
                    cotton. It usually contains small amounts of flavoring or food coloring.[1] It is made by heating and
                    liquefying sugar, and spinning it centrifugally through minute holes, causing it to rapidly cool and
                    re-solidify into fine strands.[2] It is often sold at fairs, circuses, carnivals, and festivals, served
                    in a plastic bag, on a stick, or on a paper cone.[3][4][5]
